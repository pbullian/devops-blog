Networking in the cloud differs a lot from traditional networking on physical locations. Starting from creating VPCs, you will notice a different approach (greatly simplified) to have a secure and well managed network environment. 

I also introduced Infrastructure as Code, as a must-have when you are creating this kind of infrastructure.

I also explained the different ways to connect your traditional network with cloud environments.

Do not forget to check out the best practices mentioned at the end.

The presentation is in Spanish ;).
